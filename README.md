## Overview
A simple yet interactive traffic light simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to control a virtual traffic light with 'stop', 'slow', 'go', and 'clear' buttons, demonstrating basic web development concepts and interactivity.

## What is the Purpose of a Traffic Light Simulator?
Traffic light simulators are excellent tools for teaching the basics of web development and programming logic. They provide a visual and interactive way to understand how user inputs can affect the system. This simulator, in particular, is designed to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM based on user interaction, providing a practical example of how front-end technologies work together to create dynamic web applications.

## Installation
  1. Fork and clone the repository to your local machine. 
  2. Open the repository in your preferred IDE.
  3. No additional installation of dependencies is required as the project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
  1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the simulator.
  2. Use the 'stop', 'slow', 'go', and 'clear' buttons to control the traffic light.
  3. The traffic light will change colors according to the button pressed, demonstrating basic interactivity and DOM manipulation.
